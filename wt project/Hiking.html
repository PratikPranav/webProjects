        <p> A reliable hiking shoe is a long-lasting shoe that won’t leave you in the middle of the trail. For long-distance backpacking, shoes need to be supportive 
            and, preferably, lightweight. They also need to feel flexible and comfortable when walking. 
            However, on rough surfaces, shoes might have to be stiffer and more supportive.
            Hiking footwear also needs to be functional and be able to respond to changing environments and different surface types.
            This usually depends on the boot construction. If you want to learn more about the components of hiking shoes as well as the materials from which they
             are made, you can check out our post on the anatomy of hiking shoes.</p>

             <p>
                <b>Length from heel to toe</b>
                Size is the first thing to consider. It’s an important measurement but shoe fitting may not be successful if only length from heel to toe is considered. Keep in mind that shoe sizing is not standardized so sizing between manufacturers is not consistent. Moreover, variability in size may exist even among styles of a particular brand.
                <b>Arch length</b>
                Arch length is the measurement from the heel to the ball of the foot and is a more important measurement than the foot length. It will determine how the foot fits inside of a shoe, which determines shoe functionality. Considering the arch length is so important because the shoe needs to flex at the proper location.
                <b>Width of the foot</b>
                The width of the foot is measured at the ball region. Just as with sizing, manufacturers use different measurements for measuring width.
                <b>Weight</b>
                For most good hikers, the weight of the shoe is an important consideration when choosing hiking footwear. 
                That’s why many experienced backpackers prefer wearing lightweight hiking shoes such as the Salomon XA Pro 3D. Others give more credit to leather hiking boots as more solid and reliable footwear. 
                In general, long-lasting hiking boots are heavier. When maintained in good shape, they can last several years or more.
